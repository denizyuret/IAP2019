# Knet Tutorial

This tutorial introduces the programming language Julia and the Knet deep learning
framework. By the end, the reader should be able to define, train, evaluate, and visualize
basic MLP, CNN, and RNN models.  Each notebook is written to work stand-alone but they rely
on concepts introduced in earlier notebooks, so I recommend reading them in order. Every
Knet function outside of the standard Julia library is defined or explained before use.

To run the notebooks on a Jupyter server, start julia in this directory then install and run
IJulia by typing the following at the `julia>` prompt: (see
[IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) for more information).

    julia> using Pkg
    julia> Pkg.add("IJulia")
    julia> using IJulia
    julia> notebook()

These notebooks are also available in [Google
Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19D-R31unxZV_PUYYYpCfd-gnbdUiZfNb?usp=sharing)
which should let you run them on [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) provided you add Julia
support first using the [colab_install_julia](colab_install_julia.ipynb) notebook.
